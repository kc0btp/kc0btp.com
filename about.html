			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>This is a small site created to document my hobbies and tinkering. I might add more, I might not. I might play around with the design (such as it is), I might not. After all, this site if one of my tinkers.</p>

			<p>While I hate to mention anything about <b>blog</b> or <b>CMS</b> around here (I very much prefer static sites), my <a href="arch.html">Arch</a> page has started to turn into a kind of journal of my snail-like voyage through configuring an Arch linux machine. A simple list made sense to document the basic installation, but maybe I'll consider dated entries at some point in the future. I'm not really interested in a full-blown blog (certainly nothing like a blogging platform), but breaking it up a little wouldn't hurt. I recall a static site generator I used many years ago... Octo-something-or-other... so perhaps I'll poke around and see what I can find.</p>
