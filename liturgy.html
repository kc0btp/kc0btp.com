			<h1>Liturgy</h1>

			<p><a href="https://github.com/kc0btp/liturgy">Liturgy</a> is a simple python script that calculates the holy days of the liturgical calendar. The primary source for my calculations has been the 1662 Anglican Book of Common Prayer, though I am not Anglican and the audience for this is not any specific denomination.</p>

			<h2>Motivation</h2>

			<p>The ultimate goal of this project is to display the current liturgical period or holiday for the current date in <a href="https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/">dmenu</a> so I can easily see what season I'm in. I also thought it would be a fun, little project for me to play with to get back into some coding. Most of the math is pretty straight-forward, and it's allowing me to iterate over possible solutions while doing something useful at the same time.</p>

			<p>Be forewarned that I'm not presenting this as a paragon of software development. I'm sure pros would easily pick my sophomoric attempt at python, but I'm doing this for me and not to impress anyone. However, I figured I'd share in case anyone is interested.</p>
